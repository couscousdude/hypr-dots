# Hyprland dotfiles

Based on [prasanthrangan/hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots),
with my minor modifications.

- `Super + C` rebinded from opening `VSCode` to `neovim`.
- `Super + H` opens the audio device selector
- Refactor to use `YUIO` instead of arrow keys for switching windows, for
  increased ergonomics
  - `YUIO` is Vim's `HJKL`, shifted up one row to avoid some key conflicts
